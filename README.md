# regsys
A simple login-registration system.

Introductory C++ project. 

Code will ask for username and password.
Upon successful registration, a user file is created with the credentials.
If the user does not exist, upon login, an error will be shown.

Based on [@HazardEdit's](https://github.com/HazardEdit) tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_aWPGCaaFA). I do not take credit for the code outlined in this video.
